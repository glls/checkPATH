by George Litos (Oct 2014), made with [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/)

A simple yet useful application to easily distinguish invalid paths in your PATH environment variable.

Display path enviroment directories in a list, non existing directories are colored red, duplicates are blue.

______
Notes:

The PATH is not updated if it changes outside of the application, you must close and re-run to update it, so refresh is used only to check directories.

Tested in Windows/Linux/MacOSX
