by George Litos (Oct 2014), made with [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/)

A simple yet useful application to easily distinguish invalid paths in your PATH environment variable.

Display path enviroment directories in a list, non existing directories are colored red.

______
Notes:

the PATH will not update if it is changed outside of the application, you must close and re-run to update the PATH, so refresh is used only to check paths.

Tested in Windows/Linux/MacOSX
